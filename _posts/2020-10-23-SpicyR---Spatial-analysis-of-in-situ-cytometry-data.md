<b>Abstract</b><br/>
Highly multiplexed imaging techniques such as cyclic immunofluorescence \(CycIF\), as well as the mass cytometry based techniques<br/>imaging mass cytometry \(IMC\) and multiplexed ion beam imaging \(MIBI\), has allowed many antibody parameters to be visualised<br/>within the same image. These technologies enable a variety of distinct cell types to be analysed concurrently in their native<br/>microenvironment. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that cell microenvironments are programmed not just by cell ontogeny, but<br/>by signals from the microenvironment. Highly multiplexed imaging hence provides the necessary spatial data required to interrogate<br/>the role of the microenvironment and identify any interdependencies between complex cell subsets in health and disease. Standard<br/>image processing, cell segmentation, and cell classification, the phenotype of a single cell and its position within an image can be<br/>identified. However, the analysis of the spatial relationships between these cells can be difficult. Here, we present the statistical use of<br/>marked point process models to identify the spatial relationship between different cell types. Specifically, these models can be used<br/>to identify specific localisations and avoidances between pairwise cell types. This approach can provide insights for immune responses<br/>in cancer models, autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis, and in infectious disease such as HIV. Such models<br/>can prove to be useful for applications in other high parameter disease models.
