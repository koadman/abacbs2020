<b>Abstract</b><br/>
Immunotherapies provide effective treatments for previously untreatable tumors, but the molecular determinants of response remain to be elucidated. Here, we describe a pipeline, ISOTOPE \(ISOformguided prediction of epiTOPEs In Cancer\), for the comprehensive identification of cancer-specific splicing-derived epitopes. Using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry for MHC-I associated proteins, ISOTOPE identified neoepitopes from cancer-specific splicing event types that are potentially presented by MHC-I complexes. We found that, in general, cancer-specific splicing alterations led more frequently to the depletion of potential self-antigens compared to the generation<br/>of neoepitopes. The potential loss of native epitopes was validated using MHC-I associated mass spectrometry from normal cells. Furthermore, analysis of two cohorts of melanoma patients with ISOTOPE identified that splicing-derived neoepitopes with higher MHC-I binding affinity associate with positive response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Additionally, we found a more frequent depletion of native epitopes in non-responders, suggesting a new mechanism of immune escape. Our analyses highlight the diversity of the immunogenic impacts of cancer-specific splicing alterations and the importance of studying splicing alterations to fully characterize the determinants of response to immunotherapies.
