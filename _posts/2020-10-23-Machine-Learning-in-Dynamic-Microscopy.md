<b>Abstract</b><br/>
The tracking of individual, proliferating cells over time has long been more accurately done by eye than by algorithm. Fully automated, simultaneous tracking of multiple cells remains a daunting challenge, particularly for highly motile cells that grow and divide over days or weeks. Here we examine the use of deep convolutional neural networks to track several generations of T-lymphocytes through tens of thousands of time-lapse microscopy images. Neural networksare trained on short sequences of consecutive frames, where time is rendered in the 3rd dimension. This converts the usual 2D detection plus association problem into a single 3D problem. The network is required to identify cells \(classification\) and determine cell positions \(regression\). An additional neural network is used to perform high-quality segmentation of each cell in its cluttered environment. These networks work together to provide an automated solution for extracting cell lineage trees from movies of proliferating cells.<br/><br/><br/>
