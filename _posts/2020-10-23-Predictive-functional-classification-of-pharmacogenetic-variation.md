<b>Abstract</b><br/>
Pharmacogenetic variation is important to drug responses through diverse and complex mechanisms. To predict the functional impact of missense pharmacogenetic variants, predictive tools are employed that primarily rely on the degree of sequence conservation between species as a primary discriminator. However, off-target drug-variant interactions commonly involve effects that are unrelated to their intended biological function, which likely violates the assumptions of the predictive methodology.<br/><br/>We have exhaustively assessed the effectiveness of missense mutation functional inference tools on the pharmacogenetic missense variants contained in the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase \(PharmGKB\) repository. We categorize PharmGKB entries into sub-classes to catalog likely off-target interactions , such that we may compare predictions across different variant annotations.<br/><br/>Functional inference tools perform poorly on the complete set of PharmGKB  variants, with large numbers of variants incorrectly classified as ‘benign’.  We find substantial differences amongst PharmGKB variant sub-classes, particularly in variants known to cause off-target, type B adverse drug reactions, that are largely unrelated to the main pharmacological action of the drug.  Specifically, variants associated with off-target effects \(hence referred to as off-target variants\) were most often incorrectly classified as ‘benign’. These results highlight the importance of understanding the underlying mechanism of pharmacogenetic variants and how variants associated with off-target effects will ultimately require new predictive algorithms. We describe how to identify variants associated with off-target effects within PharmGKB in order to generate a training set of variants that is needed to develop new algorithms specifically for this class of variant.  Development of such tools will lead to more accurate functional predictions and pave the way for the increased wide-spread adoption of pharmacogenetics in clinical practice.<br/>
