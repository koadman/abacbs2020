<b>Abstract</b><br/>
Metagenomics studies have provided key insights into the composition and structure of microbial communities found in different environments. Among the techniques used to analyze metagenomic data, binning is considered as a crucial step in order to characterize the different species of microorganisms present in microbial communities. We propose two binning methods, GraphBin and MetaBCC-LR, to bin metagenomic sequences. GraphBin makes use of the assembly graph to refine binning results and to enable detecting shared sequences among multiple species. MetaBCC-LR is a new reference-free binning method which directly clusters long reads based on their k-mer coverage histograms and oligonucleotide composition.
